 <s>This package provides the database interactions for a UC Berkeley Calendar system.</s>
 <d>This package creates and upgrades a relational database used to store event publishing details
					formatted using the University of California Berkeley Calendar Network schema. The backend provides
					basic functions for an event management frontend, as well as a public frontend.</d>
 <da>2006-11-09 16:43:22</da>
 <n>Schema updates to use unique index names so sqlite can be used.
Backend fixes for specific instances of non-cached pages hanging.
Fix event.datecreated from being reset.
Added lots of documentation now available at http://pear.unl.edu/docs/UNL_UCBCN/

UPGRADING NOTE!:
Users upgrading from previous versions may have to manually add some indexes and 
manually copy the old database file. This is due to a name change for some of the 
indexes including the primary key for the user table which is a text field.

This change was made for the calendar to support SQLite.</n>

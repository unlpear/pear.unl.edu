 <s>A Management frontend for publishing University events.</s>
 <d>This package gives authenticated users access to publish events into their own calendar for their Department/Unit within a University.
        It uses PEAR Auth to connect with existing authentication sources (LDAP etc).
        It handles authentication for the user and allows insertion of event details into the calendar backend.</d>

 <n>* Add a screen for recommending events to other calendars. This allows a user to post an event to another calendar the user has access to. ?action=recommend
* Fix to actions on paginated results - when a user selected an action on events from the second page the action was not performed.
* Coding standards fixes.
* New drop down for selecting actions within the default/unl template.
* Fix - defaults for uidcreated and uidlastupdated were not being set on the Create Event Form.</n>

 <s>A public frontend for a University Event Publishing system.</s>
 <d>This class extends the UNL UCBCN backend system to create

            day view.</d>

 <n>Bugfix Release:
* Events which were not 'all-day events' and start on the last day displayed in the month widget were not showing up. - bsteere
* Fix searches for the word 'art' - ART is a timezone identifier for Argentina, and would simply return the current time offset by a few hours. Fix provided by Mark Kornblum at Cornish.
* Fix mismatched variable name in getURL, pass through an ongoing event boolean when each day is constructed.

Template Updates:
UNL template -
* Compatibility updates for the icalendar format - 75 char limit etc.
* Ensure special chars are encoded in the XML output.
* Add additional public info and directions to the event instance output.
* Minor CSS tweaks.
* Add class to upcoming events header to allow styling.
* When you try to go back to today from event instance page on another month, return to today icon breaks.
* Increase default calendar subscription links to 100 upcoming items.

NEW Vanilla Template -
* Vanilla template can be used for frontend output - not dependent on the UNL templates.
To use the vanilla template, just enter 'vanilla' when prompted for which template to use.</n>
